The "Strategic Portfolio Optimization" project utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to optimize asset allocation in an investment portfolio. It analyzes historical data of bonds, stocks, and bank deposits to forecast future market trends. The main objective is to maximize returns while minimizing risks within a defined budget. Key features include diverse asset analysis and strategic use of analytical methods like Sharpe ratio and expected returns calculation. This project is ideal for demonstrating the application of simulation techniques in financial portfolio management.
